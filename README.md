## **🚀 How to Run the Project**

**Prerequisites:**

* **Install Node.js and npm:** Download and install the latest version from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/). This also includes npm, the Node Package Manager.
* **Install MySQL:** Download and install MySQL Community Server from the official MySQL website (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/). 
* **Install Eclipse IDE:** Download and install the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers from the Eclipse website (https://www.eclipse.org/).

**Steps:**

**1. Backend (Spring Boot):**

   * **Set up the database:**
      1. Open the MySQL command-line client.
      2. Create a new database: 
         ```sql
         CREATE DATABASE db521;
         ```

   * **Import the Spring Boot Project into Eclipse:**
      1. In Eclipse, go to **File > Import > Existing Maven Projects**.
      2. Browse to the directory where your Spring Boot project is located and select the `pom.xml` file.
         ```bash
         spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db521
         spring.datasource.username=your-username
         spring.datasource.password=your-password
         ```
      3. Update **your-name** with your database username and password.
         

   * **Run the Spring Boot Application:**
      1. Right-click on the `Application` class in the `com.spring` package.
      2. Select **Run As > Spring Boot App**.

**2. Frontend (Angular):**

   * **Open the Angular project in VS Code:** Open the terminal within VS Code and navigate to the root directory of your Angular project.
   *  **Install angular:**
      ```bash
      npm install -g @angular/cli
      ```
   * **Install dependencies:**
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

   * **Start the development server:**
      ```bash
      ng serve
      ```

   * **Access the application:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` (or the port specified in the terminal output).
